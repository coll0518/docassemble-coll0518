  Welcome to the Equal Opportunity Commission Disability Report Alert 
  
  
  This service will assist you in the following areas:

   - 	Submit an disability access alert report directly to venues.

   - 	Allow you to download a PDF copy of the report, along with the relevant law       that applies to your situation. 

   -	Provide relevant legal information regarding disabilities, accessibility and       your rights as per the current law in South Australia. 

   -	Provide venues with relevant legal information highlighting the obligations       as per disability access laws under The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (SA).

  The alert report that you may submit regarding an accessibility issue it not the   same as a formal complaint submitted to the Equal Opportunity Commission. 

  If that is the avenue that you seek, this service can provide you with the   necessary link to make a formal complaint. 

  Instead, this program has been designed so that you may easily and anonymously    report an accessibility issue directly to the venue itself. As stated above, if you wish to also make a formal complaint to the Equal Opportunity Commission the option is there and the link will be provided to you.
